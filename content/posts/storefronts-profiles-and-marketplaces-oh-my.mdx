Need a one stop shop for creating and selling NFTs? Want to follow your favorite web3 personalities? What about activity tools? Want a branded marketplace, where you set and collect your fees? How about an ability to add multiple collections and creators straight from your wallet? If these sound good to you, then welcome to Holaplex where we have your covered with whatever web3 NFT product you need to succeed as an artist.

## Storefronts

The URL’s look something like “x.holaplex.com” and they are the first product and the one that most in the ecosystem know. They are the OGs. The place Boogle and many other 1/1 artists got their start. This is the all-in-one 1/1 art store that you own which allows minting, auctions, and instant sales all in one place.

## Profiles

Next up is the newer, faster, and higher performing sibling to Storefronts…Personal Profiles. Profiles are linked to your wallet and twitter(if you use services such as[ Cardinal](https://www.cardinal.so/) to link) essentially turning any wallet into its own NFT store. It is a place where you can list your NFTs for sale, make or accept offers of both collected or created NFTs, view your own on-chain activity as well as view your own alpha feed.

All of this is done through Metaplex’s escrow-less contract, which means that your NFT never leaves your wallet until it is sold! No more losing your NFT for days after putting it up for auction.

Also a part of the Holaplex profiles is ‘Social Graph.’ This is a new open-source and decentralized social NFT network which supports the “follow/ following” function that builds a personalized ‘Alpha Feed’ of those that you have followed and their activity. This helps creators engage with their followers in Web3.

Soon these profiles will “grow up” to match their storefront brethren’s auction house capabilities. This means auctions right in your profile without ever having to give up your NFT!

If you’re interested in creating and viewing your own Holaplex profile then you can do so by visiting[ Holaplex.com](http://holaplex.com/) → Connect your Wallet → Click Profile Button on top right where wallet was and walaa! Your very own Holaplex profile.

## Marketplaces

They’re the new hot product that everyone’s dying to get their hands on. They’re hip. They’re fast. They sell things. They’re Holaplex’s Marketplace Standard and they’re coming to a store near you! Well maybe not a store, but soon they will be popping up all over the Solana Ecoystem(Like here — <https://monkedao.holaplex.market/> or here <https://market.skeletoncrew.rip/> ) as more individuals, teams, and projects see the benefit of owning their own marketplace.

Like everything we make it is open sourced and utilizes the new escrowless contract from Metaplex’s Auction House protocol.
