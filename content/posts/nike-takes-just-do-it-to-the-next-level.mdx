Nike has generated over $185 million in revenue through the sale of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This impressive figure puts Nike's success with NFTs well above that of other major enterprise brands. It's clear that Nike is taking its "Just Do It" slogan to heart.

Nike's introduction of "Nikeland," a virtual reality world built in collaboration with Roblox, was the first time it had entered the metaverse. It wasn't until Nike acquired RTFKT that the company began producing its own NFTs; nevertheless, when StockX offered NFT versions of the Swoosh's sneakers, Nike defended its digital likeness. Clearly, there's money to be made from digital collectibles, and the brand isn't one to pass up opportunities.

Nike's NFTs have been some of the most popular and sought-after in the space, with one token selling for over $100,000. Nike's first line of virtual shoes, Cryptokicks, launched April 2022 and has 20,000 NFTs available for purchase - including one created by world-renowned artist Takashi Murakami. The most expensive piece in the collection sold for $134,000. The company has plans to release more NFTs in the future, and it is clear that they are well on their way to becoming a major force in the world of digital collectibles.

According to [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/kingjames23/nft-project-possible-data-to-use), Nike has made $93.10m in primary sales of NFTs with their total royalties at $92.25m.  This puts Nike's total NFT value at $185.40m, which is an incredible achievement for a company that only entered the space a few months ago. Comparing their success with other enterprise brands, nobody comes close to topping Nike. 

Dolce and Gabanna's total NFT revenue is currently at $25.66m followed by Tiffanys at $12.62m.  Nike's direct competitor, Adidas, currently has a total volume of $10.95m. Nike’s early indications of success signals opportunity to increase shareholder value and extend brand leverage by utilizing web3 to deliver novel digital engagements. 

A barrier for adoption is the lack of understanding around NFTs. For enterprise brands, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the technology before jumping in.
