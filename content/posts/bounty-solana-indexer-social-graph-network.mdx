description: Bounty Offered to work on Solana's leading indexer and social graph
---

Work with Solana developers to build open-source software that benefits the entire ecosystem. Offered both at Austin Hacker House (June 4-9th) and virtually, this bounty provides a unique opportunity to flex your frontend development chops and become more familiar with core on-chain technologies. This project is meant to appeal developers just getting started developing in the Solana ecosystem or are already established.

## Bounty Overview:

Holaplex has developed a high performance indexer and social graph. We seek developers and designers to visualize this information in compelling, informative, impactful and creative ways. This visualizer or dashboard would be deployed on a Holaplex webpage as well as at Hacker House NFT galleries.

It’s already powering [www.holaplex.com/alpha](http://www.holaplex.com/alpha), now we want to see what you can make of it!

#### Bounty Reward:

Up to $7,500 USD will be rewarded.
