Dialect is the first protocol for smart messaging — dynamic, composable dapp notifications and wallet-to-wallet chat. They currently power messaging for over 15 dapps across Solana and also provide tools for builders - Customizable React Component Library, Flexible Monitoring Toolkit, and their Dialect Protocol - open source protocol, enabling composable, censorship-resistant on-chain messaging. Furthermore, they raised a 4million+ seed round to bring smart messaging to Solana.



Chris received his Ph.D. in physics and worked at a quantum computing startup for several years. After dabbling in the Web2 problem space, he brought Dialect into Solana/Web3 late last year.

Chris shares his vision with us for smart messaging on Solana, some of the unique challenges and opportunities that come with building on Web 3.0, the importance of open source, and more. We also explore how Web3 has brought on a new identity for consumers. ‏
