Yesterday, [Starbucks](https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2022/the-starbucks-odyssey-begins/) launched its web3 loyalty program and is radically changing the perception of NFTs for enterprises. In short this is signaling that NFTs and Web3 is the future of brand marketing and  loyalty and rewards NFT program is perhaps the most lucrative place to start. It has the ability to deliver powerful customer engagements that other technologies fail to do. 



With a loyalty and rewards platform customers can now own their loyalty status and engage in meaningful experiences with the brand. Traditional web2 loyalty is transactional, has limited utility and is another walled garden. As NFTs proliferate across the physical and digital world, opportunities for meaningful collaborations between brands, creators and consumers emerge.   



Customers can now earn points for actions beyond just spending money, creating opportunities for brands to incorporate gamification all while providing value-adding rewards that have the flexibility to be traded and utilized as desired. Gone are the days of generic discounts and email marketing promotions. 



Web3 gives businesses the ability to extend advantages outside of physical locations and engage communities in much more exciting ways. The pace of innovation in this space is extremely fast and we can expect to see more and more new consumer engagement tools come online. A recent example of this is [Solana Pay](https://solanapay.com/) and the ability to programmatically provide discounts at point of purchase with qualifying NFTs in the customers wallet. 



The first of many brands that will use web3 to position themselves for success in the digital age is Starbucks. With 100 million+ customers, most of which don’t have wallets yet, Starbucks is using frictionless web2 onramps to instantly bring a massive customer base on-chain. The emphasize the importance of abstracting crypto from the entire process including removing crypto lingo. For example, Starbucks is replacing NFTs with straps. 



### How does the Starbucks Odyssey NFT program work? 



According to [Campaignasia](https://www.campaignasia.com/article/building-an-nft-customer-loyalty-programme-what-brands-need-to-know/481692), “This loyalty program will allow its members to earn and buy NFTs through activities, such as playing interactive games or taking on fun challenges related to their knowledge of coffee and Starbucks.”

Starbucks customers can also buy limited edition NFTs using a credit card through an integrated marketplace within the Odyssey app without the requirement for a cryptocurrency wallet. Depending on how uncommon it is, each valuable digital stamp is given a point value. Members can buy or sell the stamps, and a blockchain verifies ownership. Members' points rise as they earn stamps through the programme, opening up rewards and experiences like a virtual espresso martini lesson, access to products, and artist collaborations.



What does this mean for the future of web3? It’s no longer for crypto degens. Its a powerful engagement tool ready for mass utilization. A loyalty rewards program is a wallet and customer extension mechanism. Start simple and expand as the technology evolves.
