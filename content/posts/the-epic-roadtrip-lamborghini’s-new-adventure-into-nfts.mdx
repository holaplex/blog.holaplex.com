Lamborghini is taking us on a new adventure into NFTs. Their newly released NFT collection is available for purchase from August 2022 - March 2023. “The Epic Road Trip” program will last during these 8 months and at the end will end in an ultimate reveal. But what is the real utility and is Lamborghini giving real value to its current customers?

**The Overview:** **How the program will work**

Each month there will be 4 NFTs to collect - 3 collectable NFTs, available only for 24h each ($196.30 each) with the 4th NFT being an extremely rare edition of which only 63 will be minted; a nod to the genesis of Lamborghini’s 1963 foundation ($1,963 each).

Each month you collect the series, you receive a puzzle piece. At the end, those who have completed the puzzle will have access to an ultra-rare and exclusive “reveal” NFT.

**The Rewards:**

**3 unlimited NFTs each month receive**: A commemorative digital wallpaper (both mobile and desktop) of each drop series will be provided

**2 complete monthly collections will be rewarded:** A digital artwork by Mitja Borkert, [Head of Design](https://www.motor1.com/news/category/design/) at Lamborghini, produced for "The Epic Road Trip" campaign.

**First 4 months of NFTs will have:** An opportunity to participate in a special tour of Lamborghini's HQ in Sant’Agata Bolognese.

Let’s do the math. If you were to collect 3 NFTs for the month, you would be paying almost $600 for a wallpaper. Is this enough utility to keep consumers engaged with the collection? In addition, what value will this “reveal” NFT bring to its holders? If you are spending thousands of dollars on puzzle pieces, you’ll want to know what is at the end of the rainbow.

Lamborghini seems to be too focused on trying to make these NFTs collectible rather than expanding value for current owners or expanding the brand to aspirational followers to provide unique experiences.

There are lots of other ways to keep your fans engaged long term. Here are some other impactful utility ideas for your NFT collection:

* Physical merchandise
* NFT print on canvas
* Access to exclusive events
* Special access to an online community/club
* Early access to Lamborghini releases
* Vehicle upgrades for current customers

and more…

The first series of four NFTs were released on August 8, 2022, on [Lamborghini's NFT website](https://nft.lamborghini.com/TheEpicRoadTrip) and we are curious to see what level of participation Lamborghini will have on this “epic road trip.”

Lamborghini isn’t the only luxury car brand who is entering the NFT space. [Bentley](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/bentley-is-latest-auto-brand-planning-nft-launch/) will release its first NFT drop in September while [McLaren](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/mclaren-automotive-plans-luxury-car-nfts-with-infinteworld/) is planning a collection. In addition, [Audi](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/audi-launches-novel-fractional-nft/) launched an NFT collection in May 2022 and [Porsche](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/porsche-to-auction-car-sketch-as-nft/) auctioned a car sketch as an NFT.
