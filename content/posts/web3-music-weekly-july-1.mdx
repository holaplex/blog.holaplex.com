Welcome to another edition of Web3 Music Weekly! Your new home for all the latest web3 music news, NFT releases, and more - curated weekly by Holaplex's own in-house music addict and NFT enthusiast, Blake Nania. 

NFT NYC was a blast. Much love to everyone still out here doing the web3 lord's work and continuing to move the needle forward in spite of the current conditions. The bear market is still hitting tough but after getting to meet with some of the top projects moving the needle in the space IRL, I'm feeling as optimistic as ever for where we're headed. There is still a ways to go until music NFTs are where they need to be for widespread adoption but if there is one thing that remains the same - community building, collaboration, and the continual spread of knowledge are crucial to long term success.

Keeping things on a positive note, here are a few fun new projects making moves in the space üëá

Iconic rapper/producer/designer/entrepreneur extraordinaire¬†Pharrell, who recently entered the¬†NFT¬†space with his own¬†[Gallery of Digital Assets (GODA) project](https://decrypt.co/101125/pharrell-williams-web3-is-scaring-the-system), will join Doodles as Chief Brand Officer in efforts to help shape the collection‚Äôs approach to music, artwork, consumer products, animation, and events.

In even more exciting news for the music space, Pharrell will also be executive producing a Doodles-inspired collection of songs entitled "Doodles Records: Volume 1," releasing in partnership with Columbia Records.

This is the first major web3 project of its kind to bring on a musical artist of this stature as a full-time decision maker and what better man for the job than one of the culture's biggest visionaries. Cannot wait to see what the üêê cooks up.

## Avenged Sevenfold on Using NFTs to Give Back to Fans

Avenged Sevenfold is a multiplatinum, chart topping heavy metal band fronted by Matt Sanders (aka M. Shadows). Sanders and his band mates have been early advocates for NFTs, launching their own NFT project in fall of 2021 called the Deathbats Club in fall of 2021, which aims to bring more utility to their community. Holders get Metaverse access, Web3 sneak peaks, first dibs on concert tickets, and much more. 

In an insightful new episode with NFT NOW he discusses: 

\- Why rock and metal musicians have been slower to catch on to NFTs

\- How technological shifts have driven massive changes in the music industry

\- How NFTs can augment how artists engage with their communities

\- The merchandising potential of NFTs for artists and musicians

It's always great to hear artists who are deep in the game share their knowledge with the community so big kudos to the boy M. Shadows for being a thought leader for the people. More of this please!
