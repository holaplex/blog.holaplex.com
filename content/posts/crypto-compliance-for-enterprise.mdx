  attention than usual. Blockchain is one of the current frontiers of innovation
  & there is always an abundance of scammers, grifters and bad actors in every
  frontier. Combine that with the ease of carrying out illicit activities, the
  uncertainty in regulatory frameworks in many jurisdictions & the sheer amount
  of ever-evolving risks that can arise every single day, making sure your
  business stays compliant is a persistent problem in need of a good solution.

Q. How many compliance officers does it take to change a light bulb?

A. Three. One to change it, one to check it and one to check it again and file a report.



This is a joke on the fact that compliance officers tend to obsess over checking things closely, but that is a necessity for Web3 businesses, as it can help detect & help prevent financial crimes, shielding businesses from all regulatory & legal headaches. 



In the landscape of Web3, being compliant requires far more attention than usual. Blockchain is one of the current frontiers of innovation & there is always an abundance of scammers, grifters and bad actors in every frontier.

The optimist thrives, but the pessimist survives.



Being a pessimist and preparing for worst-case regulatory scenarios, is crucial for any web3 business that scales. However, making sure you’re compliant, that no bad actors are interacting with your platform, that the funds you’re receiving aren’t tainted & the transactions you’re facilitating aren’t being used for malicious means, isn’t an easy task.

It involves a lot of careful due diligence, building wallet screening & transaction monitoring tools, geo-blocking software, AML/CTF blacklists, and making sure no sanctioned entities can interact with your platform. 



Fortunately, Holaplex takes care of all compliance needs for enterprise clients. Enterprise clients of Holaplex don’t have to worry about building & maintaining compliance technology & tools, which means clients can continue to focus on their business while we make sure they remain compliant with all rules & regulations. This is doubly relevant for those clients who aren’t native to Web3 or making their first strides in this space, as Holaplex helps them comply with all rules & regulations from the very beginning. 



Holaplex’s compliance service for enterprise clients offers a couple of very important features. These are-

## Core features

### Screening for high-risk wallets

* This includes wallets based on the AML/CTF & sanctioned lists
* Wallets are auto-blocked & blacklisted based on the lists, and the blacklist remains updated at all times

### Flagging suspicious transactions

* Checks for wash trading & tainted funds
* Categorize suspicious transactions based on risk levels automatically, so that the Holaplex compliance team can spend their time on investigating what matters the most
* Monitor internal activity within the client’s enterprise for insider trading

### Tracking & visualizing the flow of funds

Thus, Holaplex ensures that clients continue to conduct their business safely, staying compliant with all rules & regulations at all times. In the fast paced world of cryptocurrencies, being compliant often takes you further than any other business decision you can make. Regulatory hurdles & legal proceedings based on not being compliant can often be detrimental to businesses trying to scale. Holaplex makes sure that never happens to enterprise clients, making sure that every client's business adheres to the highest compliance standards possible. 

The optimist thrives, but the pessimist survives. 

Holaplex’s wide range of enterprise offerings allows businesses to do both.
