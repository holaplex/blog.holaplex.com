  Takeaways from Solana Hacker House (Bengaluru) -
---

Hacker house Bengaluru is Solana’s first Hacker House in India, and just from the picture above, one can tell that it was an enormous success.

I was there representing Holaplex (we had a lovely NFT gallery there showcasing Holaplex artists!), like we do at all Hacker Houses. Here are my takeaways-

# Why are Hacker Houses so special?

This was a hacker house where over 1500 people showed up on the first day, but only 600 were allowed to enter due to the capacity of the venue. One can assume that people would be disappointed or angry about this, and although many were at first, by the time the Hacker House ended, everyone had a smile on their faces and a deep longing for the Hacker House to last longer.

This wasn’t just a developer conference. A crypto meet-up rarely is.

This was a gathering of people who are all aligned on the same beliefs, involved in a culture where co-operation not just among different individuals working on vastly different projects, but even cooperation among competing companies and corporations is encouraged.

One has to ask- why? Why are these communities so passionate? Why is this culture relevant? And how is the bond so strong?

I don’t have concrete answers to these, but I can take a stab at it from my perspective.

# A community of people sharing the same beliefs and ideals

There’s a reason why some people are choosing to work in Web3, over Web2. This was the Hacker House crowd.

These are all people who believe in decentralisation, community and privacy. They believe in censorship-resistance, the existence of all ideals and ideologies- especially the ones they don’t agree with. But more than that, while large Web2 companies may scoff at the idea of using a blockchain over a centralised database to solve modern problems and give up their power, these are the people who not only believe that it is possible, but that it is a fairer and more transparent alternative.

These are all people who went against the crowd, the wisdom of the masses, and everyone’s choosing to carve a path of their own with a technology that the world around them doesn’t believe in (yet). While many usually invest their capital in this technology and there’s nothing wrong with allocating capital and speculating on the future value, the people who attend these Hacker Houses are the ones who are putting it all on the line.

These are the people with the most skin in the game, and they’re investing a resource far more valuable than money- they’re investing their time.

Combine all these innate beliefs and bring these people together under one roof, and you can start to understand why these meetups are special. They’re not just bringing together developers and people interested in programming- they’re bringing together people with strong shared beliefs who all want to make the world a better and fairer place.

And let’s face it. Development is a lonely pursuit most of the time. That’s how we like it too. The most efficient of all developers would choose remote work over in-person office work, and crypto enables that better than anything else.

Ask any developer whether they’d want to leave their multi-screen cozy personal setup and commute to a workplace, only to do the same job on an inferior setup, and the answer is mostly a resounding no. There’s something magical about sitting down on your computer and working hard, entering the flow state, and not worrying about distracting coworkers till you get your work done.

Remote work is a better option for crypto companies too. Most companies working on blockchain tech aren’t building for a specific local community. They’re building for the world at large and that is only possible when you have a diverse and globally distributed team.

Thus, it was of no surprise that professional developers there were all working remotely for companies on the Solana ecosystem.

Bringing all of them together, finding out what they’re building, helping them build things better and connecting them with other like minded people, all these are something that only Hacker Houses can accomplish.

# A paradise for early adopters

You could walk up to any developer or any team and just introduce yourself. You could ask them about what they’re building. If they’re building something relevant to what you’re building, you could talk about combining forces, or at the very least help them out with what they’re doing and they’d gladly do the same for you.

Keep in mind that some of these teams could be billion-dollar companies in 10 years, and they’re all there- sweating it out, “chewing glass” together, and trying to build great products.

In my opinion, Hacker Houses should be sponsored more heavily. Where else do you get the attention of hundreds of developers, managers and VCs, all working in the same ecosystem? These will be the same people bringing along billions of other users or building out products that do. This is an audience worth paying attention to.

# Age doesn’t matter if the vibes match

I found this to be doubly true for the Hacker House crowd. There were people of all ages there, starting from 16 to 60, and everyone was equally getting along with each other. While developers were usually between the ages of 20 and 40, most of the managers and VCs seemed to be above 35. There’s a saying that if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.

At HH Bengaluru, I wasn’t in the wrong room.

From all the talks and panels and tutorials, I learnt things that I had never known before. I got to ask questions to VCs about tokenomics and seed rounds. I got to learn marketing tricks from Tanmay Bhatt, a person with millions of followers on social media. I got to meet people who I had only known from Twitter. The whole room was a crypto twitter feed, without the spam bots.

But then, something interesting happened as the Hacker House progressed. The market crashed as a stable coin de-pegged.

As the market crashed, where there should’ve been doom and gloom- there was a deep sense of camaraderie among everyone else. Everyone’s portfolio was down. It wasn’t like anyone was safe.

# We’re always going to make it, even in the bear market

Everyone was “down bad.”

But that was okay, because we’re all down together. Humor’s often the best response and there was a lot of it surrounding the market’s events. Jokes about returning to McDonald’s, not partying because their portfolios were down, but coming to the parties to celebrate, regardless.

Everyone knew that we’d bounce back from this, if not in months, but definitely in years, and that’s what we all showed. The Hacker House displayed that a market crash doesn’t send the passionate builders away. A bear market only affects the speculators. Most builders usually double down during this time and come out stronger.

“We’re all going to make it,” a true testament of the ecosystem’s culture and that was on broad display among everyone else.

# The real treasure was the friends we made along the way

But more than all of that, I got to make new friends. Friends who I’d have never met if I had never met. As we grow older, making new friends seems to get hard. There are only a few other things you can do to meet new people, and the chances of them sharing the same interests or beliefs as you- are rare. The last time I was in a place with hundreds of different people who didn’t know each other but wanted to, and there wasn’t loud music playing all the time, was back in college.

The next time was in Hacker House Bengaluru.

For all the new friends I’ve made, I’d always be grateful that I decided to go.

I’m not missing it next time either. If there’s a Hacker House in your city, please visit it. You’ll not regret it!
