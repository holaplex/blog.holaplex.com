**Decentralization is a core value of Web3. But why is it essential?**



1. People can participate in a system w/out gate keepers or central authorities In a decentralized atmosphere, no one has to know or trust anyone else. Each member in the network has a copy of the exact same data. If something was altered or corrupted, it would be rejected. No waiting for approval from a dictator or worrying about what happens if the application were to shut down. Everything is on-chain for the community.



2. Lowers risk of systemic failure Single points of failure can halt a network. With multiple nodes, applications can remain up and running. If an application isn’t decentralized, it can shut down leaving you without support.



3. Creates an open culture Traditional corporate companies as we have seen can be run by politics. In a decentralized environment everyone is open to collaboration which fosters more innovation. In addition, being open sourced expands opportunities for network growth.



“Decentralization isn't solely a technological approach. It's a mindset and culture that doesn't seek one's way, but rather seeks the best way for an entire ecosystem.” - Kenny Kline
