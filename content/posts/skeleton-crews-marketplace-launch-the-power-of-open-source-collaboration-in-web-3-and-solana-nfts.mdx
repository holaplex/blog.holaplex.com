title: "Skeleton Crew’s Marketplace Launch: The power of open-source collaboration in Web 3 and Solana NFTs"
date: 2022-04-06

This week we are happy to announce and highlight the accomplishments of the [Skeleton Crew](https://skeletoncrew.rip/) as they have taken the [Holaplex](https://holaplex.com/) values of Open-Source to action and have not only launched their own [marketplace](https://market.skeletoncrew.rip/), but have contributed back improvements that were merged into the code. Contributions like these are important as they are what keep the ideas of community and collaboration alive which are the foundations of Open-Source Technologies. It is through these efforts we can also help to build decentralized blockchain technologies.

These decentralized technologies are the prime focus of Holaplex and the Skeleton crew as they both are here to serve the artist community. The Skeleton Crew is a collection of artists all centered under their "SKULLS" NFTs. These are a collection of 6,666 hand-drawn and algorithmically generated skulls built from over 400,000 combinations. The proceeds of these skulls have gone to helping their [DAO efforts](https://skeletoncrew.rip/#roadmap) which include development of self service tools and their creator academy to help artists in the Solana NFT community.

The Academy identifies and supports emerging creators in the Solana NFT ecosystem. The mission is to support talented artists by providing technical assistance and helping market their art to collectors in the space.

Another incredible technical accomplishment that should be highlighted is that the Skeleton Crew have created an open-source self-serve tool box to help create generative drops which also utilizes Metaplex's Candy Machine. But don't worry if you're not a coder as this project is also available in a no code option via their paid beta. We have to be excited for the Treat Toolbox as it will allow more generative NFTs to be on chain which goes to increase the strength of the Solana chain as well as increase the amount of art and collectors in the Solana NFT Ecosystem. Bringing opportunity to everyone is the definition of WAGMI so a big tip of the hat from us at Holaplex for that.

Their self hosted fork of the [Holaplex](https://holaplex.com/) Marketplace Standard has enabled Skeleton crew to quickly launch their own marketplace where they can have ultimate control over the technology, their brand and the creators on their marketplace. Their entire collection of their "SKULLS" can be found on their marketplace with transaction fees going directly to their DAO. Creators from the Academy will also be featured in their marketplace making it easy for collectors passionate about this project to see the latest up and coming creators.

Their mission is to enable collectors and creators to list and sell wherever they wish, in fact Skeleton Crew slated to be one of the early Solana NFT projects to be listed on OpenSea. However, if collectors sell and buy on the official Skeleton Crew marketplace they will be supporting the project's DAO and we hope to see the community rally behind such a great project.

Plus thanks to [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) AuctionHouse, NFTs are listed escrow-free, making even more convenient for collectors to buy, sell and make offers.
