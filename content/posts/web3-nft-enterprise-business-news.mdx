Holaplex provides a suite of blockchain and NFT products and services to power brands building new business opportunities in Web3. Holaplex makes the process of creating, selling and managing digital assets, both simple to execute and valuable for your business. Our robust suite of tools for enterprises building in Web3, are supported by a community of developers who contribute to critical open source projects we initiate.

Over the last year, products and tools built by Holaplex have been used by thousands of entrepreneurial creators to sell Solana NFTs. These tools used by thousands of Holaplex customers leverage the same critical core of open-source software that ensures enterprise businesses with millions of customers have the most user-tested and durable applications in Web3. 

Currently, we support over a dozen Solana dApps and protocols through our infrastructure service business to provide high-performance utilization of the blockchain. Additionally, we have partnered with Campus which provides officially-licensed collegiate tokens that unlock exclusive access to teams and athletes. With over 20 nationally ranked colleges and hundreds of athletes, Campus is continuing to grow and we are excited to support their web3 vision at scale. 

Most recently, we have worked with the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, during their launch into Solana NFTs. Holaplex worked with OpenSea to implement a version of our Command Center product for deploying NFT drops at scale and has been utilized for their launchpad services. 

As we expand our enterprise offering, we continue to maintain our core values of open-sourced software development and decentralization. Open-source development provides strategic advantages by increasing the velocity of product development, improved security, and ultimate flexibility with no licensing fees. Web3 is a rapidly growing technology and building openly ensures the technology stack is never out of date. We are proud to continue to be one of the top open-source web3 contributors. 

Why shift focus to support businesses? A profound opportunity exists for brands to exponentially increase shareholder value. It is this opportunity that has encouraged us to continue to build for businesses. Web3 and the world of NFTs present an entirely new playing field – A multi-dimensional commerce network in which brands can increase the leverage of their brand, offer customers expanding brand extensions, and access an entirely new suite of digital tools to drive engagement.

“The adoption rate and revenue figures for web2 brand entering web3 reminds me of the early days in crypto where we saw a massive explosion of wealth generation and opportunity,” says Alex Kehaya, CEO Holaplex. 

The top 10 grossing brands who have made the jump to web3 which include Nike, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Adidas, Budweiser have generated $1.4b in transaction volume (primary and secondary sales) accumulating to $266m in total revenue collectively. ([Source](https://dune.com/kingjames23/nft-project-possible-data-to-use): [Dune](https://dune.com/kingjames23/nft-project-possible-data-to-use)) While this is a small fraction of total annual sales, web3 is proving to be a viable new revenue stream for brands who know how to best utilize this new technology.
