Tiffany’s collaboration with the leading NFT brand, CryptoPunks, signals the increasing utilization of NFT intellectual property for luxury good brand. This opportunity injects Tiffany’s into new market segments of the crypto native and crypto curious while CryptoPunk holders see increased leverage of their NFT asset.

**Overview:**

On August 5th, two iconic brands, Tiffany’s and CryptoPunks [went live](https://nft.tiffany.com/) with 250 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) priced at 30 Ethereum (ETH) each. The project sold out in 22 minutes and raised the ETH equivalent of $12.5 million.

[CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) is one of the earliest NFT projects developed on the Ethereum blockchain and launched June of 2017. The project consists of 10,000 algorithmically generated 24x24 pixel portraits with randomly chosen attributes like hats, sunglasses, etc. It’s amazing to see the growth of the project over the past 5 years. @foreverpunksnft shares a screenshot of early trading of CryptoPunks on Discord: [](https://twitter.com/foreverpunksnft/status/1559482375943380998)<https://twitter.com/foreverpunksnft/status/1559482375943380998>

CryptoPunks gained popularity rapidly and is now considered the blue-chip NFT project on Ethereum.

The Tiffany’s NFT drop all started when Tiffany’s Executive Vice President of Product and Communications, Alexandre Arnault, turned his CryptoPunks NFT into a physical pendant. Naturally, other CryptoPunk community members expressed a want for their own pendants via a Twitter Poll.

Tiffany’s sold 250 "NFTiffs," digital passes which were minted and redeemed for custom-designed CryptoPunks pendants and a matching NFT art piece. To purchase the exclusive NFT, customers had to already own a CryptoPunk. Ultimately, the “NFTiff” becomes a certificate of authenticity of the pendant bought. If not redeemed, the art piece remains a digital collectible in the owner's crypto wallet.

**“NFTiffs” Add Value To The Original CryptoPunk NFT**

The CryptoPunks collection took a hit in sales during the initial market downturn in May and June with the floor averaging at 48 ETH (approximately $48k). The day of NFTiff’s initial announcement caused the floor price to increase to 76 ETH (approximately $122k) on August 4th. As of August 24th, the floor price has now leveled out to 66 ETH (approximately $105k).

On Aug. 15, a new IP licensing agreement will be released that grants CryptoPunk NFT owners full commercialization rights to create projects and derivative products, such as merch, brands, or movies based on their owned artwork. Yuga Labs, who recently acquired the CryptoPunks project, already offers Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT owners these rights.

"Owning a token does not just mean this JPEG belongs to you," said Davis - CryptoPunks Brand Lead. "It means you have certain rights with regards to what you can do with your CryptoPunk, what kind of IP you can build around it. There are extremely few restrictions."

**Why this is beneficial for the ecosystem:**

This release also represents the increased coupling of luxury brands and cryptocurrency/NFTs. Iconic brands like Gucci, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana, and more have all launched a project involving NFTs. Gucci in particular has launched many crypto projects this year including: [SUPERPLASTIC](https://opensea.io/collection/superplastic-supergucci), [Vault Art Space](https://vaultartspace.gucci.com/), [Gucci Town](https://www.roblox.com/games/7830918930/Gucci-Town) (on Roblox), [10KTF Gucci Grail NFTs](https://vault.gucci.com/en-US/story/gucci-grail), and [The Sandbox](https://vault.gucci.com/en-US/story/metaverse). All can be accessed in their [Vault](https://vault.gucci.com/en-US/story/metaverse). In addition, famous auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have sold NFTs for jaw-dropping prices. In March, Christies seized the attention of the art and cryptocurrency worlds by selling an NFT artwork for $69 million. The digital piece from artist [Beeple](https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx) — a collage of his first 5,000 days of work — stands as the most expensive work of digital art sold and marked Christie's first-ever sale of non-physical art.

"If we are heading into an era where the virtual world is going to become more important and essential to our lived experience, owning virtual goods is going to be that much more valuable," said Davis. "To get an edge on that, for these luxury companies to enter the space now when we are really still early, it's brilliant and it makes perfect sense.

**Hot Take:**

All in all, buyers receive a gorgeous custom piece from an iconic brand and Tiffany gains exposure to this new wave of cryptocurrency/blockchain while building a line that has a built-in pool of consumers. Meanwhile, the CryptoPunks project gains more exposure to the non-crypto-savvy audience. The crypto whales (wealthy collectors) tell their friends about the project, FOMO ensues, and the project’s volume goes up. It’s a smart business decision for both parties and we expect other brands to start following suit.

This collaboration represents a successful launch strategy for a Tiffany’s, a brand looking to inject itself into NFTs at this point in time. A campaign like this is tightly focused on a niche of established crypto native users and could be a good jumping-off point to a larger sustained Web3 strategy. Although, launching a project at this scale requires a lot of knowledge and development. This is where Holaplex’s suite of tools and experience can best be utilized to bring Web3 to the masses while managing compliance and regulations.

Our robust enterprise Web3 platform can handle the minting of thousands of collections and millions of NFTs with just a few clicks. If you want all that web3 has to offer but not the headaches of dealing with crypto, our merchant passthrough service can ensure that all you receive is fiat.

Tiffany’s nailed the timing with current NFT momentum and is excited to see how they and other luxury goods brands look to Web3 to provide further shareholder value and expand their brand.
