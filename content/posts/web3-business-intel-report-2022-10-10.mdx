### Metaplex has announced a no-code tool called Creator Studio to create, sell and manage NFTs

Artists, musicians a most creators aren’t familiar with the nuances of setting up self-hosted marketplaces by themselves. Thus, Metaplex’s Creator Studio, (a name that they hopefully didn’t intentionally adapt from Meta’s Creator Studio), aims to eliminate the friction by building a no-code solution that anyone can use.

### Crossmint announces their NFT API

The Crossmint NFT Mint API allows you to create and send NFTs to your users with a single line of code, even if they don’t have a crypto wallet. Anyone can use it to create NFT tickets, loyalty cards, rewards, certifications. APIs are the building blocks of composability in crypto, so this would allow others to build useful apps utilizing quicknode’s APIs.

### Magic Eden drops to having less than 50% marketshare.

Magic Eden has long been the de-facto NFT marketplace on Solana. Despite on-going controversies regarding stealth mints & project verification, it seemed for a while that the top marketplace throne will remain occupied forever. No marketplace, no amount of controversy & no evidence bad practice was capable of taking MagicEden’s #1 spot away. That all has started to change in the recent months leading to new NFT marketplaces emerging that don’t honor creator royalties, doesn’t take marketplace fees & offers additional utilities like P2P lending & liqiudity pools. Magic Eden thus, dropped from having 95% market share 6 months ago to having below 50% for the first time in 2022. The downtrend might continue, and it’s easy for unicorns to disappear in every crypto winter. Will they be able to survive? Only time will tell.

### FTX and Visa partner to permit crypto payments in 40 countries

$FTX coin spiked 7% after this was announced. These movements are always indicative of the fact that institutional adoption continues to scale, with large institutions continuing to understand how important crypto payments are.

### Binance smart chain suffers an exploit

Initial estimates of compromised funds were as high as $100 million worth of cryptocurrency. However, hours into the situation, the network announced current estimates of exploited funds to be around $70–80 million, with $7 million successfully frozen. Bridges continue to remain vulnerable to exploits in Web3, but they’re still a necessity in the cross-chain future. Where code is law, every such exploit ends up making the anti-fragile ecosystem of crypto a little bit stronger, hopefully leading to an era where this ecosystem is more robust & secure than traditional banking infrastructure.
