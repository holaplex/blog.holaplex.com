OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, sought a technical partner to expand and scale multi-chain services to Solana. Holaplex has proven to be OpenSea’s ideal partner, by leveraging our deep Web3 expertise working within enterprise companies, Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg, Cameo, and Google, to deliver stable and scalable web3 technology.  



Holaplex delivered bespoke open-source software for minting and launch pad services. Under a rapid timeline, Holaplex had built the foundational technology which supported the successful launch of OpenSea’s new launch pad platform, featuring [Zoonies](https://opensea.io/collection/zoonies/mint) and [Monkai](https://monkainft.com/).



“OpenSea will make launching their Solana NFT projects as painless as possible. Creators can execute a new mint from pre-mint activities to post-mint and secondary sales. Furthermore, the Solana launchpad experience will allow list minting for the community and supporters.” - [OpenSea ](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-solana-launchpad/)



## Enterprise-grade NFT minting and launchpad tools delivered at scale.  

Developing products for a new blockchain posed several unique challenges. OpenSea needs deliver a world-class product to its users at scale. Partnering with Holaplex enabled OpenSea to leverage our extensive knowledge in developing Web3 NFT technology to provide a robust enterprise blockchain solution. 



### Bot Proof Candy Machine (minting tools)

**Problem:** Bots present an unfair advantage with their ability to quickly take supply of the mint. 

**Solution:** Multi sig solution that utilizes captcha to reduce bot activity. 

Candy Machine, Metaplex’s open source NFT drop protocol is ubiquitous with the success and adoption of Solana NFTs and the PFP drops that flooded the market. With popular drops, bots presented an unfair advantage with their ability to quickly take the supply of the drop. Holaplex created a multi-sig solution requiring the hosted marketplace to sign the transaction only after a captcha bot confirmed that the user was not a bot. This greatly reduced the use and exploitation of programmatic bots during the minting process.

### Programmatic Purchase Groups supporting multi-token drops and unlimited whitelists

**Problem:** Poor user experience for whitelists users with unuseful restrains for NFT projects

**Solution:** NFT free whitelist with limitless whitelist spots built to scale. 

Whitelisting presents a powerful mechanism to drive interest and hype around up-and-coming NFT drops, yet the typical user experience is very poor. First, a list of wallet addresses is gathered and a specific whitelist NFT is sent to each address. Secondly, users must have the whitelist NFT in their wallet to access the mint site early before the public drop.

Holaplex has simplified the whitelist process by not requiring the issuance of an NFT. Simply, the project provides the wallet address they wish to provide access to their pre-sale and users will gain access to the minter once their wallet is successfully connected. No whitelist NFT is required. 

As a result, whitelist access is highly flexible providing limitless whitelist spots all while being more cost-effective. Additionally, This solution provides scalability for larger launchpads and marketplaces. 

Additionally, multi-token support for drops has been supported enabling various Solana SPL tokens to be utilized when minting. 



### Enterprise Grade Drop provisioning

**Problem:** Bottleneck between creatives passing off with the blockchain in preparation for - format metadata and scrips - Can’t do it at scale 

**Solution:** Programmatic Solution to deploy large NFT drops at scale. 

Candy Machine drops are intensive to build, requiring careful collaboration between creators with their creative assets and developers who need to take these assets, format the metadata, and program scrips. This process is not scalable by marketplace launch pads desiring to support multiple drops a day. Holaplex has developed a programmatic solution to deploying large NFT drops at scale, significantly reducing the effort, cost, and time required to deploy a drop.

Holaplex provides bespoke solutions from our suite of in-house, open-source software developed in-house and a network of top-tiered protocol partners. Utilizing this strategy increases the speed of development while also ensuring secure, trusted, and stable code is shipped. Such was the case with OpenSea. Holaplex has been a supporter and contributor to Metaplex’s open-source protocols which were utilized as the minting protocol for the drops tool. Developing openly provides more flexibility by being able to easily maintain your code base independently of Holaplex if so desired. This means no licensing fees and full access to the software utilized. As a result, OpenSea is now able to maintain its launchpad tools independently.
