In response, Sweeney said: *“Developers should be free to decide how to build their games, and you are free to decide whether to play them. I believe stores and operating system makers shouldn’t interfere by forcing their views onto others. We definitely won’t."'*

"Japanese gaming publisher [Square Enix](https://twitter.com/SquareEnix) has partnered with blockchain gaming firm Enjin to release NFTs based on its infamous role playing game (RPG) franchise Final Fantasy. More specifically, the NFTs are being made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of original PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII.

Set to drop in the spring of 2023, the NFTs cards will be released via six-card physical packs that’ll cost $4 a piece. Each pack will come with a code, which when redeemed on Enjin’s Efinity platform, will provide owners with a single **Final Fantasy NFT card** that’ll reside on the Polkadot blockchain.

In November 2023, the publisher will then release a limited edition action figure that’s based on the game’s main protagonist, Cloud Strife. Again, the physical figure will have a code on it which can be used to redeem an NFT certificate of authenticity. In addition, the physical figure will also come in a more expensive ‘Digital Plus Edition,’ which will include a code that can be redeemed in order to receive a **NFT digital replica** of the toy.

The blockchain endeavour from Square Enix comes amid a flurry of other blockchain-infused plans that have been partly funded by the [offloading](https://nftplazas.com/square-enix-offloads-tomb-raider-to-fund-blockchain-initiatives/) of its prized Tomb Raider franchise. One of its most recent and notable Web3 moves has been its [inauguration](https://nftplazas.com/rpg-dungeon-siege-ip-added-to-the-sandbox/) of Dungeon Siege IP into The Sandbox."
