Welcome to another edition of Web3 Music Weekly! Your new home for all the latest web3 music news, NFT releases, and more - curated weekly by Holaplex's own in-house music addict and NFT enthusiast, Blake Nania.

As we continue to feel the effects of the bear market, let's remember what Kate Bush said - "keep runnin up at that road, keep runnin up that hill" 🏃🏻‍♀️ A bear market is a builder's market so let's keep to the path and not forget why we're all here. Let's keep it positive, stop checking Coinbase, and go for a walk in nature this weekend if you can. \

Here are some fun new projects and upcoming events I'm excited about 👇

## Mija - I'm With the DJ Mixtape NFT

Renowned DJ/singer/songwriter Mija recently released a free mint of a mixtape with the aim of easily onboarding new fans to her community while simultaneously promoting her upcoming tour by offering a free ticket to one of her upcoming shows. We’ve seen mixtapes released as NFTs before but not like this, where accessibility is simplified and owners receive something tangible beyond just ownership of the music release itself. I genuinely see free NFTs as the way forward for music artists. In all my time spent in music marketing, giveaways are the easiest way to get people’s attention, and what better way to onboard non-crypto-native fans than by providing them with something valuable at little to no cost to you. I hope we see a lot more of this from the music community moving forward.

## Bored Brothers Release Free Mint on Glass

Bored Brothers are a newly formed metaverse band comprised of superstar duo Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic) and trop-house king Kygo. Yesterday they released a free mint on Glass Protocol of their new music video to holders of their previously released “Drip” NFT.

Metastars, as emerging projects like these have been coined, are entirely digital entities backed by NFTs and DAOs. Similar to what we covered last week with Wuki’s Wobblebug project, the goal with these projects is to create an entity larger than the creators themselves, allowing for deeper access to holding fans through collectible, community-owned experiences and exclusive offerings such as mint passes, rarity traits, airdrops, governance, and more.

Bored Brothers are another prime example of what a community-run project can do and what web3 music releases can look like in this new frontier.

## Russ Appears on Royal Radio

R&B hitmaker Russ dropped by Royal Radio to drop some knowledge bombs on the music industry and finding success as an artist. You can listen back to the recording [here](https://twitter.com/join_royal/status/1535019199860441088?s=20&t=VWAvXabAe6YicpRSoA8hxA) and check out some of the key quotes and takeaways below:

1. _“If you’re an up and coming artist, just worry about two things: developing your craft by putting out your music as often as possible in a digestible way. And engaging with your fans.”_

2. _“People are always like how did you find an audience? You don’t, they find you.”_

3. _“You can’t skip the groundwork... If you’re trying to be a big artist the best way to do that is song by song, brick by brick, and staying really active on social media with your fans.”_

4. _“Everyone is so obsessed with going viral. Try your hardest to go viral today. And it may not happen. But the song you put out today could go viral in two years. But imagine if you didn't put out the song, because it didn't go viral in your snippet…”_

5. _“My focus was, number one, make the best music I can make. And number two, put it out as frequently as possible, and build up a fan base because I knew that if I did that, that I would have people knocking on my door instead of the other way around.”_

6. _“I was able to move without the motivation of money because I financially liberated myself by owning my catalog. People don't realize there is money in selling music. You just have to own it.”_
