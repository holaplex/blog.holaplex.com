Fake NFTs suck and it is not always easy to discern which NFTs are authentic. But now, getting authentic NFTs from credible creators is simple.

A new joint product launch from [Cardinal](https://www.cardinal.so/) and [Holaplex](https://holaplex.com/) helps NFT creators authenticate their NFT wallet and their Twitter account directly from their Holaplex profile. This integration creates a one-to-one relationship between the Twitter account and wallet ensuring that no-one else can verify the same Twitter account. Authenticity is provided via an NFT that is minted and stored in the verified wallet, in what is a truly authentic Web3 experience.

Once the connection has been established, the Twitter handle will appear rather than the abbreviated wallet address, plus your Holaplex Profile pulls in your Twitter profile picture and banner.

[Boogle](https://twitter.com/solBOOGLE), the very best NFT project on [Solana](https://solana.com/), with over [10,000 SOL volume](https://www.hellomoon.io/nfts/boogle-gen-1) is using the integration via their Holaplex Profile. The Boogle team demonstrates just how easy it is for anyone to authenticate their Solana wallet.

## How to connect your Solana wallet to your Twitter account. 

The best part is that anyone with a Solana wallet has access to this verification integration. Here is how:

1. Visit holaplex.com
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click view profile by clicking your placeholder avatar in the top right corner
4. Once your profile loads, under the default avatar click the button called ‘Link Profile’
5. A pop-up will appear. Click verify. This will open up a new tab and preload the verification tweet. Make sure this is the Twitter account you want to connect your wallet to.
6. Post the tweet. Do not edit the tweet. This is how Cardinal knows that you are the owner of this account.
7. Copy the URL of the tweet
8. Paste the URL in the appropriate field in the Cardinal pop-up form in your Holaplex Profile
9. Click Claim. This will mint an authentication NFT keep this in your wallet
10. Verify the transaction (this covers the cost to mint the NFT and run the verification program)
11. Once complete, reload your profile page to see your updated profile.

## When we build open-source software we win together 

Open source software increases the velocity of innovation because the community of developers can make use of what is already built. Standards and protocols that are open are essential if Solana is to be adopted by the masses.

Holaplex and Cardinal’s partnership exemplifies how open source collaboration provides a benefit to everyone. Because our Social Graph and Profiles software is open and available on our Github, the Cardinal team could easily fork the code and integrate their identity validation program directly.

Thanks to them verifying wallets have gotten easier, thus making purchasing NFTs on Solana even safer. In fact, there are already nearly 50,000 verified wallets thanks to the efforts of both Cardinal and [Bonfida](http://bonfida.org). By virtue, open source enables us to share resources and win together.

Shout out to Cardinal for this amazing integration to our open-source software and big thanks to [Jords](https://twitter.com/earlyishadopter) from Boogle for generating the demo video.
