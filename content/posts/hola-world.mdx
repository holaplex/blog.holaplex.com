“Hello, World in Rust”

OK OK OK...enough of the code talk.

It just seems that being stuck in Web 2 for so long I started to speak it myself. Not that there’s anything wrong with being able to speak with our processor brained companions, but as an artist I often get overwhelmed with all the new Web 3 and its promises.

I am told my creativity has no bounds, but then I am hit with the sad reality that to even launch my collections I will need to learn to code…OR WILL I?

INTRODUCING….\*Drum roll please\*

We’re the open-sourced, decentralized, community-driven suite of platform tools focused on empowering the creator and community to be able to accomplish their goals and all the tasks they need without ever needing to know a line of code.

We are a close partner and are built on the Metaplex protocols and are the only platform that allows creators to fully own their own storefront rather than giving their ownership or a % of sales to the marketplace platform they are using. In addition, we are fully stored on Arweave making us even much more decentralized.

But that’s enough about us. This was just an introductory lesson anyways. We want to know about you! Let us know about the projects you’re dropping soon and WAGMI!
