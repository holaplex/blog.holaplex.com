Welcome to another edition of Web3 Music Weekly!¬†Your new home for all the latest web3 music news, NFT releases, and more - curated weekly by Holaplex's own in-house music addict and NFT enthusiast,¬†Blake Nania.

Despite all the current hearsay surrounding our current state of affairs in the market, a music NFT summer is indeed upon us folks. Today, we're covering a topic that has been at the forefront of my mind since entering the space: the future of web3 concerts. Also in other major news, two of music tech's biggest early disruptors have also officially entered the web3 chat. Let's dive in, shall we?

## The Web3 Dream of an Equitable Nightlife Industry

As someone who‚Äôs worked in the nightlife industry for a better part of the last 10 years, the premise of what web3 can mean for concerts has been something at the forefront of my mind since I first started participating in the space back in December of last year. I‚Äôm extremely invested in this topic and ready to dive into this deeper with you all.¬†

In a newly published feature on [Resident Advisor](https://ra.co/), one of the electronic music scene's most reputable magazine and community platforms, they pose some thought-provoking insight into the future of the nightlife industry in the form of web3, with DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) playing a crucial role. A DAO, generally speaking, is a group of people working together for a shared goal with no central leader. Members typically hold a stake in the form of an NFT or a token issued by the DAO, allowing them to jointly vote on proposals and actions.

**What could this mean for nightlife?**¬†

Over the past decade plus, we‚Äôve seen a multitude of complications arise in the way nightclubs and event producers have gone about their business. Some of the main issues being: oversaturation in the market, repetitive festival lineups, underpaid workers, higher operating costs, lower ticket sales, and event producers only booking artists who can draw a crowd based on social clout or streaming numbers, limiting the scope of left field programming and innovation.¬†¬†

Under this new community driven model, where DAOs are characterized by equality and inclusion rather than a sole focus on financial success, we may be able to find a path forward. For employees who feel overworked, overlooked, and underpaid - this may be a turning point for those who have felt uninvolved by the powerhouses in their industry. By promoting various forms of equitable and inclusive ownership, DAOs allow their members to have a say in booking marginalized or local talent, decide which independent venues and small businesses they work with, and avoid the plight that so many smaller artists and venues face: being sidelined by the current mainstream event corporations who recycle the spirit that creatives have fought so hard to maintain.

**So, what are the specific benefits of these blockchain networks making a voice for themselves in the music festival and nightlife industry?**¬†

These niche genres may finally get their place on the marquees. Members source their own lineups to represent their favorite marginalized artists. Those who work in production, security, hospitality service, or behind-the-scenes roles can finally have a say in the field that they‚Äôve been systemically pushed to the side by the talent and those that have been leading the industry for decades.

Cherie Hu, founder of [Water & Music](https://www.waterandmusic.com/), has spoken on the need for this infrastructure and DAO awareness for the average festival-goer - and it surprisingly (to some) begins with curation. "People need some kind of guide or navigator to help sift through that noise otherwise, they're gonna be very overwhelmed or confused to the point of not wanting to participate as consumers or supporters. Curation inherently provides value by cutting through noise, I think, in a music industry context." There is a specified need for these voices and these curators who can understand the needs of both the regular festival or music junkie, but also translate the seemingly murky world of blockchain involvement. To get the rest of the public involved or even interested, there has to be more awareness and education on how they can participate and what they can expect out of their efforts. With the existence of this knowledge gap, anyone who wants to become involved in this new frontier could get lost amongst the noise.

Water & Music aims to close this gap by releasing surveys to understand its members and providing various channels for announcements, conversations, and feedback. "Ideally, as the community grows, you're having more people on the ground getting feedback and that feedback is then being synthesized and aggregated in some way that is communicated across the organization in terms of priorities," Hu stated.

This empowerment and infrastructure has to exist to give members routes to ownership - and some networks are currently operating in this realm successfully. [Refraction](https://www.refractionfestival.com/) and [Friends With Benefits](https://ra.co/features/3914) (FWB) are two notable names in this frontier, successfully building parties and events that bring NFT collectors and those who worship electronic music together. Malcolm Levy, the founder of Refraction, has spoken on the goal of these events: "The goal is to curate lineups that speak to different kinds of audiences and communities," Levy says. "Within all aspects of electronic music, there's some level of gatekeeping in curation but we just want to create a framework where the process is transparent and actually makes sense."

Refraction is one of the DAOs pioneering this movement - and this new movement understandably comes with risks. Those who attend Refraction‚Äôs events are from the blockchain and art world, according to participants, and not so much an average concert-goer. In addition to bridging that gap, those corporations leading the festival industry will still always prey on the independent spirit that creatives work so hard to authentically empower and maintain. At the blockchain festival New Forms, Levy saw how larger brands who were interested in working with New Forms branch off to copy his original vision. ‚ÄúCorporations don't always understand the ethos behind the music they promote,‚Äù Levy says. But if you have those corporations keeping an eye on your efforts, you must be doing something right. ‚ÄúThe mainstream has always borrowed, and often straight out stolen, from the underground. You can see that happening at Coachella."

DAOs, like any revolutionary idea, are still a risk. But with risk comes reward. The potential is easy to see in an industry that has been reduced to the same few corporations making the same decisions for an increasingly concert-thirsty world. Almost every other corner of the music industry is being disrupted by the blockchain, so it‚Äôs only natural that concerts are next in line. Let‚Äôs hope this next chapter comes sooner rather than later - before next festival season, maybe?

## Limewire Launches NFT Marketplace

![](uploads/limewire.png)

The once beloved file-sharing service Limewire has been resurrected and now plans to "bring digital collectibles to everybody". The launch of the reinvigorated platform comes alongside the announcement of some major artists set to release on the marketplace, including Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, Dillon Francis, Nicky Jam, and Brandy. [The new marketplace](https://limewire.com/browse) will offer a range of original songs, visual artworks, backstage passes, and other in-person opportunities.¬†

The company is placing emphasis on its ["Originals"](https://limewire.com/originals) concept, which is a limited collection of 10,000 original NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain. Owners of an ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù NFT will receive access to invite-only events, token rewards, and early access to NFT drops.

According to Limewire, the company wants to appeal to a wider range of consumers by removing the need for a crypto wallet, allowing potential buyers to use a credit card for payment, as well as offering to cover any related gas fees that come alongside the purchase of an NFT.

It‚Äôs crazy to see how far we‚Äôve come since the days of ripping illegal music files, spending countless hours manually inputting song titles and uploading album art into iTunes, but this new resurgence from music tech‚Äôs early 00s bad boys is set to turn things around by returning the value of music back into the creator‚Äôs hands.¬†

## Napster Outlines New Web3 Music Ecosystem

Another one of the music industry‚Äôs biggest disruptors, Napster, has also announced their foray into web3. In a recently released V1 Litepaper ([sign up to read](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.napster.com%2Fweb3&esheet=52766178&newsitemid=20220629005792&lan=en-US&anchor=napster.com%2Fweb3&index=1&md5=dc27d2b8f51208b4e594b71f7ee4e3a1)), the former music tech giants (now subscription-based streaming service) outline their plans to apply web3 technology to its existing business and millions of users in order to improve how music makers, rights holders and fans can interact. The company‚Äôs new entity, the Napster Innovation Foundation, will be issuing $NAPSTER tokens using the Algorand blockchain protocol to streamline its existing platform functionality as well as open up new options for creating value around streaming music.

As we enter the ‚Äòstreaming-plus‚Äô era of music, it‚Äôs incredibly exciting to see a streaming service of Napster‚Äôs scale utilize their longstanding resources and bring their proven knack for innovation into web3 as a decentralized, music-first ecosystem to the benefit of fans and music makers. Looking forward to seeing where this ship steers the industry to next.
