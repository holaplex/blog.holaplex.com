Have you ever thought man…I’d love to be able to connect and track all of my NFT interactions in one place?

Ever bid on an auction late at night during an NFT power run and forgot where and with whom you bid?

Maybe you have great taste and want to just flex on everyone that you found [Boogles](https://twitter.com/solBOOGLE) or [John Le](https://twitter.com/notjohnlestudio) before anyone else?

Whatever your desire… we here at Holaplex have listened and are rolling out another awesome open source and decentralized feature for your storefronts!

This new feature allows much more visibility and sociability to our storefronts and it is only the beginning for what we have planned for you.

So don’t be afraid.

Connect your wallet and begin creating, bidding, and selling with us!
