Welcome to another edition of Web3 Music Weekly! Your new home for all the latest web3 music news, NFT releases, and more - curated weekly by Holaplex's own in-house music addict and NFT enthusiast, [Blake Nania](https://blog.holaplex.com/post/twitter.com/wetheblake).

It‚Äôs been an interesting past few weeks for the web3 fam. The market is down and the original hype around music NFTs has begun to wear off. The days of making a quick milly off a drop are gone. Accessibility is still not where it needs to be. Releases have started to become repetitive and stale- that is until this week. Here are a few new projects who are pushing the boundaries despite all the backwash. Let‚Äôs dive in üëá

## Wuki Unleashes Wobblebug NFT Collection

Yesterday, world renowned DJ/producer, Hola homie, and web3 music leader Wuki sold out his 10,000 piece Wobblebug NFT collection, marking what is undoubtedly the biggest moment for a music NFT project on Solana to date.

[Wobblebug](https://www.wobblebug.info/) is the first tokenized musician in history that allows fans to own a piece of a DJs career. Wuki‚Äôs new alter ego will perform live shows, create and release music, host events, develop merch, and do everything your standard professional musician would do, but will be entirely driven by a community of holders who will participate in every step along the way and be rewarded based on the success of Wobblebug‚Äôs career. This project is a major step forward for the music NFT space so big shouts to Wuki and his team for breaking the mold and knocking this drop out of the park.

I had the pleasure of hanging out with Wuki and some of his team at Solana Hacker House this year when I booked him for our showcase at SXSW and was blown away by his kindness and insightfulness. He has to be one of the hardest working artists in web3, consistently setting the tone for other artists and pushing the envelope on what‚Äôs possible in our newfound ecosystem. I‚Äôm so happy to see all the hard work pay off and I‚Äôm excited to watch this project take off.

## Songcamp Debuts CHAOS

Web3 innovators Songcamp launched their latest experiment CHAOS, a ‚Äòheadless‚Äô collective of 77 artists from across the world who have come together to create a unique collection of songs and visual pairings comprising for 20,000 NFTs which can be unlocked by purchasing [‚Äòpacks‚Äô](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/HAVvPjZ9O2rUuDfRXN1CMbFk11ih4-JnJ1UyZCPTXSs). Not only is it incredible to watch this many artists come together with the same shared goal but to see a project like this utilizing [new tools](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/UkR2nfVcYYKuePHzck6UnWTY35zW4uFxRnXllkk99Hw) making sure royalty ownership is being shared and distributed properly is great to see. The market may be down but that‚Äôs not stopping projects like CHAOS from breaking new ground in the space.

## COLORSxSTUDIOS Launch Community DAO

Iconic YouTube channel and global tastemakers COLORS has officially made their foray into web3 with the launch of their Community DAO.

Since the brand‚Äôs inception in 2016, COLORS has solidified themselves as one of the foremost tastemakers in the music space with their simple, yet genius monochromatic, stripped down performance videos. Their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/COLORSxstudios/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid), which racks up upwards of 40M+ views a month, has helped launch the careers for a multitude of world renowned artists, counting Gen Z breakout Billie Eilish and influential British grime rapper Skepta among its early champions.

It was only a matter of time before the music discovery kings made their foray into web3, and that moment is officially here. The Community DAO is set to be an extension of everything they‚Äôve been doing up to this point, with the goal, as stated on their community website, to ‚ÄúAssemble the world‚Äôs most impactful interdisciplinary community of creatives, curators and tastemakers, contextualize emergent talent in the global music & Web3 space through editorial, IRL and URL experiences, apparel, NFT drops, and create unique IP for the next generation ‚Äî held by the DAO.‚Äù

As an OG fan of the brand and someone deeply invested in artist discovery and promotion, I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to see what new innovations they cook up in web3.
