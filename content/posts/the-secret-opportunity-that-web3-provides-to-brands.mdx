Behind the veil of pixilated Jpegs and illustrated apes exist a profound opportunity for brands to exponentially increase shareholder value. Web3 and the world of NFTs present an entirely new playing field – A multi-dimensional commerce network in which brands can increase the leverage of their brand, offer customers expanding brand extensions, and access an entirely new suite of digital tools to drive engagement.



“The adoption rate and revenue figures for web2 brand entering web3 remind me of the early days in crypto where we saw a massive explosion of wealth generation and opportunity.” - Alex Kehaya, CEO of Holaplex. 

The top 10 grossing brands who have made the jump to web3 which include Nike, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Adidas, and Budweiser have generated $1.4b in transaction volume (primary and secondary sales) accumulating $266m in total volume collectively. [Nike](https://blog.holaplex.com/post/nike-takes-just-do-it-to-the-next-level) is leading the web3 charge making up half of the total revenue generated at $183m. While this is a small fraction of total annual sales, web3 is proving to be a viable new revenue stream for brands who know how to best utilize this new technology.

[A study from Stilt](https://www.stilt.com/blog/2021/03/vast-majority-crypto-buyers-millennials-gen-z/) found that 94% of all cryptocurrency buyers are Gen Z or Millennials (18-40 years old). This emerging generation of Web3 natives is the next big consumer that will drive the economy and are the prime target market for most brands. The adoption of web3 is outpacing the adoption of the early internet. This is signaling new exponential opportunities similar in nature to what e-commerce and social media had on business a few decades ago.



At this time, web2 channels have reached maturity. Social media and the likes that once presented massive growth opportunities are no more. In its place are web3 commerce solutions that enable novel and powerful opportunities for brands and consumers. Early movers who positioned their companies to take advantage of emerging technology trends in the past eat the lunch of their competitors. This same opportunity exists now with web3. 



## Why is web3 more than just NFTs and JPEGs?

Web3 represents a potential for exponential opportunity. It enables customers to interact on a new network with a digital commerce layer built in. In the past, the relationship between brands and consumers has largely been a 1-to-1 relationship, where brands primarily drove activity.



Furthermore, communication, content delivery, and online interactions in web2 take place on networks that are primarily owned by Google or Facebook. The point being these channels are owned by centralized entities. 

Web3 is multi-dimensional, providing opportunities where consumers are both interacting with the brand but also with each other. This increases the various ways in which consumers interact with a brand, further enriching and enriching relationships. 



At their core, NFTs are ownable digital assets. These NFTs possess the opportunity to be valuable whether perceived by a community or by way of applied utility. Initially, the value of NFTs has been largely viewed as collectibles where a market drives value. This largely represents where NFTs have been for the last few years. Currently, NFTs that provide utility present the future of NFTs. Mechanisms can be put into place to allow NFT holders to access exclusive content, redeem goods or services, be used as a ticket to an event, provide privileges for Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAO), or can be used rewards mechanisms. NFTs that represent utility possess the biggest opportunity for businesses.

## NFT utilities can maximize value for brands

In this use case example, Brand X is a global fashion athletic company. Brand X wants to implement a loyalty rewards program represented by NFTs. These NFTs can be distributed from their storefronts via point-of-purchase stations, and/or distributed with online purchases. Customers who reached a certain reward level get sent an NFT. For our example, it will be called the Golden Ticket NFT. This NFT grants them access to a highly desirable and exclusive sneaker drop of limited quantity. The only way to get access to purchase this exclusive product is by holding the appropriate NFT which there is a limited supply. If these select customers elected not to utilize the NFT to purchase the product they could decide to sell it on the brand’s secondary marketplace. Brand X minted the NFT with a 10% royalty on the secondary sales. This means every time it is resold the brand automatically collects that royalty. 

Not only has Brand X created a new revenue stream, but it has also empowered its customers to interact with one another and created an exciting new experience around a product release. Such concepts can be applied across nearly every industry. [Nickelodeon](https://nickelodeon.xyz/) is appealing to the nostalgia of millennials with popular cartoons from the 1990s and providing gated content access, [Lamborghini](https://blog.holaplex.com/post/the-epic-roadtrip-lamborghinis-new-adventure-into-nfts) is providing novel digital experiences related to their brand and [Tiffany’s](https://blog.holaplex.com/post/tiffanys-drops-cryptopunk-pendants-and-raises-millions) is appealing to NFT culture with its exclusive CryptoPunk pendants.

## How can brands get started in Web3?

Web3 is highly technical and fragmented with over 45,000 decentralized apps, nearly 1,000 blockchains, and 250 NFT marketplaces. Fortunately, several companies cater specifically to brands with a range of offerings. Web3 studios offer fully customized one-off solutions for companies with big budgets and on the other end of the spectrum exist generic marketplaces that offer no custom branding but at a lower cost. Examples include [Veve](https://www.veve.me/), [Sweet](https://sweet.io/), [Dapper Laps](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), or [Magic Eden](https://www.magiceden.io/)



All of these examples fall short in several key areas. They often lack the ability for brands to inject their branding, have selected NFT utility tools, or impose expensive licensing fees.

## Exponential growth exists for those who capitalize on the web3 opportunity.

Top spending consumers are adopting web3 at a rate never before seen, and early movers like Nike are demonstrating opportunities to capture significant revenue. Thanks to the recent developments in the space, NFTs that possess enhanced utility create enhanced engagement opportunities with the ability to provide explosive value for both consumers and brands.
