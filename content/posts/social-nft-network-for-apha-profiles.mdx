A truely, Web3, NFT social media experience is here! Follow creators and collectors, get alpha, mint and purchase NFTs  all in one place. We have listened to the communities feedback and have built a high performance, open-sourced platform to enhance discoverability, flexibility and increase sales. Now with profiles, every wallet is a store.

Holaplex’s [Social Graph](https://github.com/holaplex/graph-program), in parallel with the [Holaplex Indexer](https://github.com/holaplex/indexer), powers [Profiles](https://www.holaplex.com/profiles/7r8oBPs3vNqgqEG8gnyPWUPgWuScxXyUxtmoLd1bg17F/nfts), a place to view and purchase minted NFTs, along with the [Alpha Feed](https://www.holaplex.com/alpha), which curates activities from those you follow. The result, a true Web3 NFT social network.

“Web3 anons, Crypto degens and NFT creators want products and experiences that they control and own so the Holaplex community is building an open-source social graph for every user on Solana,” says Holaplex CEO, Alex Kehaya. “By adopting the Holaplex Social Graph every user is free to maximize their networks and take followers with them to any application or community on Solana.”

After connecting your wallet at [holaplex.com](https://holaplex.com/), NFT buyers and creators will have a personalized display of content. Best of all, every wallet is effectively a storefront thanks to [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/)’s [AuctionHouse](https://docs.metaplex.com/auction-house/definition) protocol.

Developers behind any brand, project or DAO that embraces open-source, user-owned and controlled networks can give this power to their users by using and contributing to the Holaplex [github](https://github.com/holaplex/graph-program) or by reaching out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/holaplex?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

## Holaplex Community Creates Open Value 

The Holaplex Community has found open source to increase the velocity of innovation by enabling shared development efforts that the developer community can use to quickly build more features. Tools owned and controlled by the community of creators and collectors allow for a more collaborative and inclusive environment.

The Holaplex Community’s open-source values have  been supported  with recent integration from [Cardinal](https://www.cardinal.so/), [Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/) and [Notifi](https://notifi.network/); it includes active development from many open-source collaborators as well.
