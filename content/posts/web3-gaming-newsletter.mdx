## Star Atlas Unveils First DAO Structure

###### https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-star-atlas-dao-the-game-of-polis-fd3798aa6ebe

_“The long-term vision of Star Atlas is an autonomous, player-owned game, fully controlled and funded by decentralized governance. Therefore, from its early stages, the economy is architected to run through a hierarchy of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), fueled by the governance token (POLIS) and cash flows of ATLAS.” — Star Atlas (whitepaper)_

Star Atlas has announced the first structure of its "Star Atlas DAO." This is only one of many DAOs for Star Atlas governed under the POLIS token. Each faction in Star Atlas will have its own DAO.

POLIS locking was also announced. POLIS holders will be able to commit their tokens for any amount of time up to five years. This voting-escrow model is designed to favor community members with long-term conviction in the Star Atlas vision, to help the Star Atlas team deliver a fun game and a framework for developers and content creators to build in the metaverse.

**Additional Star Atlas Summer announcements include:**

**[Galactic Marketplace](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-new-galactic-marketplace-a-small-step-for-trading-a-huge-leap-for-the-star-atlas-metaverse-a7c4a44ee7f8):** Since its launch in 2021, the Galactic Marketplace has been the hub of the metaverse economy. Now, Star Atlas announced a complete revamp of the marketplace, with new DAO-enabled gaming foundations, a smooth user experience, and a new interface that brings the platform closer to the feel of an in-game experience on both larger desktop screens and mobile. Additionally, players will now be able to buy and sell assets directly with other players, giving the marketplace a true MMO-style community feel.

**[Star Path Program:](https://medium.com/star-atlas/starpath-the-official-star-atlas-referral-program-a08623af0c6a)** The Star Atlas team also announced their new next-gen web3 referral initiative, StarPath, focused on building and sustaining the Star Atlas ecosystem by rewarding space explorers who enlist new recruits. The referral program is designed to reward not only the players bringing other active players to Star Atlas, but also to fuel competition between in-game factions to be the top recruiting force. Individual players can redeem their points, or Prosperity Marks, for ships or other in-game assets, and the most successful faction will receive in-game buff — allowing players to enhance their characters. Going forward, the StarPath program will also unlock a range of blockchain-enabled perks and access to otherwise unattainable resources.
