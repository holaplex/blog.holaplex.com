# What is Holaplex?

Holaplex is an unapologetically creator-centric company that sees the immense value creators play in society. We see the need to empower and support creative communities to create cultural artifacts with full autonomy over their creative process and the value extracted from their work. To this end [Holaplex](https://holaplex.com/) creates open-source, decentralized, permissionless software on the carbon-neutral Solana blockchain, which enables creators to actualize their work and make informed marketplace decisions without the need to go through any intermediaries or get permission from any gatekeepers.

# How does Holaplex do this?

Holaplex is continually developing innovative web3 tools which stay true to our mission of upholding the integrity of creators by enabling them to fully own their work and all the infrastructure which distributes it.

[Holaplex Social Graph](https://www.holaplex.com/alpha) allows for anyone to maintain their followers and following across any web3 platform using this standard. Web2 social media platforms prevent their users from switching platforms by maintaining absolute control of their relationships with others and extracting value from those relationships with no obligation to serve them or give them a share of the value generated by their content.

[Holaplex Profiles](https://www.holaplex.com/profile) allow for anyone with a Solana wallet address to buy or sell NFTs without going through an intermediary. Other platforms take control over a user’s assets, thus endangering them. They require gaining approval to use the platform and maintain the power to exclude for whatever reason they wish. Additionally, they are not transparent, so there is no way of knowing if they are secure in their custody of your assets or if they are fair in their inclusion or exclusion of members.

Holaplex Marketplaces allow for anyone or any group to create their own NFT marketplace. We see the importance for community-led curation and for organizations to have the means to control how their creative work is displayed and sold while also maintaining its broader discoverability. You get to control what creators are featured on your storefront and what fees you charge. However, creators are not siloed on your marketplace alone, they can still be discovered within the broader ecosystem through any site which aggregates creators or their NFT listings.

With Holaplex, anyone can be a creator, curator or collector. Anyone can form a collective, organization or just grow their personal following and fully own it. With Holaplex you always own your relationships, your creations and the means with which you profit from them. With Holaplex you are an unstoppable force of creative energy speeding across the metaverse.

# Why is this important?

Underrepresented or disadvantaged groups of people can leverage web3 technology to fully own their cultural contributions, fairly profit from them, sidestep parasitic mediary institutions and empower themselves and their communities. We believe that web3 should work for everyone, not just those who have the most money and influence.

Web3 technology allows for creators of any medium to reach a global audience while removing the friction of shipping, purchasing, storage and preservation. It allows for creators to profit from their creative endeavors through primary sales and royalties. It allows for them to maintain a permanent record of their work, its sales and ownership history. It allows creators and collectors to maintain complex relationships without needing to know each other personally or without an intermediary. It can create much more transparent and equitable institutions to serve the interests of creators and patrons alike.

However, if we do not follow the core principles of web3 as we build this new world, we run the risk of simply recreating the old institutions. At the core of web3 are these values: decentralization, open-source and permissionlessness.

- Decentralization prevents entrenched interest groups from controlling the system they are a part of and twisting it into serving them at the detriment of other groups.
- Open-source technology allows for transparency in how a system is built. It also allows for community members to expand on, duplicate, or reinvent the system to ensure that it serves them.
- Permissionless systems allow for anyone to participate without gatekeepers or restrictions that can be used to exclude people.

By maintaining decentralization, creators fully own what they create. There is never a need to transfer ownership to a centralized authority which may not have the creator’s best interest at heart. One never needs to worry that the authority will lose interest in maintaining the system, that their incompetence forfeits the system and everything on it, or that they run off with everything they have accumulated from users.

By using open-source technology, the community can verify the validity of the technology they use. The community can expand on its reach by implementing changes which better serve them and others without needing to request someone else do it for them. The community can spin-off their own versions of the system if they ever feel that it has stopped serving them.

By being permissionless to use, the undue influence of gatekeepers and kingmakers can be limited. A permissionless system allows anyone to use it without the need to gain or maintain approval. This prevents a powerful group from choosing who gets to be successful on a platform. It also prevents oppressive forces from forcing their values onto others or keeping them from having a voice.

One of the biggest dangers of blockchain technology is that we give too much control to the same centralized powers that already hold undue power in our current institutions. Creatives have long had their value extracted by powerful organizations with little of it going back to them. The sales and royalty (or lack of royalty) systems in place for artists and musicians have placed them at the bottom of a hierarchy that should revolve around them. Without them, the industries they are a part of utterly cease to exist. In order to fulfill the promise of web3 for creatives, we have to ensure that the institutions we build and support are building up and supporting the creatives they rely on.

# Why focus on creators?

What’s really at stake here goes far beyond creatives being treated unfairly. Creators play key roles in society. They create, challenge and preserve the very fabric of humanity. Without them, we lose the means to define what it means to be human.

Creators are among the first to adopt new technologies and new ways of thinking, pushing the boundaries of what is possible for us all. It’s no coincidence that NFTs have been predominantly focused on art rather than a “more practical” use case. Nor is it a coincidence that gentrifying neighborhoods often have vibrant creative scenes. Artists are excellent at identifying areas where opportunity lies and generating value where others saw none. This is vital for maintaining innovative and transformative societies rather than bland and stagnant ones.

While the rest of society trudges along through deeply engrained patterns, creatives have the outsider perspective and creativity necessary to identify new modes of thought. The European Renaissance that followed the Dark Ages is largely remembered for the explosion of creativity that marked it. The artistic and musical artifacts which emerged were not simply by-products, but a part of the virtuous cycle of cultural and technological rebirth that occurred. We are seeing a similar pattern emerging with the current Digital Renaissance. Undervaluing the contributions of artists and creatives will cripple this revolution before it gets off the ground.

Creators are the last bastion of cultural heritage. As the world interconnects and evolves at a lightning pace, there is a tendency for what is perceived as dead wood to get burned. Languages and cultural practices are going extinct at an unprecedented pace. As we collectively seek new frontiers or chase every fad, creators preserve the cultural DNA of humanity. There is untold value and potential yet to be unlocked or expanded on from our history. Much like how we may find the next cure for disease in an obscure rainforest plant, we may find the seed for a new cultural paradigm hiding in ancient creative practices preserved by modern artists still enraptured by them.

# Where do we go from here?

Blockchain and web3 technologies are here to stay. They are too efficient and too useful to be ignored or destroyed. Like any technology, they can be used for good or for evil. If you believe in a future where the creators who help to make our society vibrant, beautiful and fun are able to fairly benefit from their work, then we hope that you’ll help us build that future.

If you’re a creator, you can join Holaplex and start contributing to the growing creative ecosystem on blockchain. If you’re a developer, Holaplex is open-source, so you can start building out the future tools and infrastructure on which web3 will rely. If you’re a curator or collector, there are a multitude of creatives on Holaplex whose work you can document or collect before they become the next Beeple or Van Gogh. If you’re an organization, you can create your own marketplace or mint your own NFTs as the backbone for your web3 membership or fundraising systems.

As we sit on the intersection of the cutting edge of both technology and creative expression, the possibilities are truly infinite. Be among the first to join us in building the future of the new creative internet.
