Abhisek delivered one of the most powerful presentations Solana Hacker House had seen. Check out the entire video bellow. The entire presentation is summarized here.

### 1. Open Source is freedom

This is freedom from centralization, from the tyranny that our digital lives are held hostage by big corporations. Open Source makes sure that alternatives can exist, that users can see & modify the source code of the software that they use every day, and thus, have the power to spin up a fairer version whenever that’s required.

### 2. Open Source runs everything and it is used by everyone

Open Source is still under-rated & under-appreciated despite the fact that everything is either Open-Source or built on top of Open Source software. From Linux to VLC media player, from Bitcoin to Solana & all popular blockchains, to even mobile operating systems like Android, to popular browsers like Chrome, the list is endless & everything we use every day is made possible by Open Source.

### 3. Open Source makes your software more secure

When any important piece of software is open-source, it gets a lot of attention from developers from around the world. These are people who may be more competent that those on your team, who may be inclined to contribute to your software based on just intrinsic interest. Thus, being open source allows you to leverage the open source community, & having more pairs of eyes going through your code ends up making your software more secure & robust in the long term.

### 4. Open Source makes you more lucky

By contributing to open source, you’re not just making sure that you’re increasing the strength of your resume, you’re collaborating with the smartest developers in the world. You’re learning from the best, for free, and this in turn, opens up a world of opportunities where you’re collaborating with different businesses, creating useful software & making the world a better place. Serendipity at scale usually ends up increasing the chances that you meet the right people, get the right opportunities or end up creating the right things that the world needs, making you more lucky than anything else you can do.

### 5. Open Source is profitable

Free Software doesn’t mean “Free Of Cost”, and there are countless business models to monetize & scale Open-Source software. These business models can be used in combination as well.

### 6. Open Source will eat everything

It was predicted that “Software is eating the world”, where traditional businesses would soon be overtaken by software businesses. That has turned out to be true. Some examples are- Amazon being the world’s greatest retail store, Uber being the global taxi service, & Netflix having more subscribers than cable. All these companies overtaking traditional businesses are just lines of code, written by developers.

However, a new trend is emerging where it can be said that Open Source software is eating software, faster than software is eating the world.

Time Till Open Source Alternative (TTOSA) measures when Open Source alternatives usually emerge of popular closed-source software, and while the usual average release of such alternatives used to be 7 years, that has dramatically gone down to a few months in recent times. Open Source licenses like the GPL license which mandates that software copied from open source code also has to honor the values of the original author, thereby indicating that copied software with the relevant changes also has to be open source.This is resulting in an explosion of open source software like never before. This constant multiplication is likely to continue as decentralized collaboration continues to scale.

Thus, Open Source is a superpower, a superpower that makes the digital world we live in - possible, and continues to make the world a better & fairer place.
