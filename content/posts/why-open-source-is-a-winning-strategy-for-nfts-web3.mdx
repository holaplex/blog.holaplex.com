Closed-sourced is a failed strategy that is not going to make it in Web3. Developing in this manner has little benefit while extracting maximum value from creators and users. This siloed approach inhibits collaboration and ultimately slows down technical development.  



We have the opportunity to prove to the world how the values of Web3 (decentralized, open and permissionless) provide long term value for all involved and is ultimately better for business. Right now the Solana NFT community has the opportunity to capture mass market adoption only if we work collaboratively. Open-source is the way in which together, we can win on a massive scale.



## Why is open source better? 



In an emerging and novel industry like NFTs, open collaboration is critical. Open-sourced standards and protocols drastically improves the available tools for developers by providing a strong foundation to get started from. This decreases costs, incentivizes better software to be developed, increases flexibility, and improves security. Simply put, open-source software drastically increases the velocity of innovation in a given industry. 



Holaplex’s suite of open-source NFT software is a great example of how open-sourced protocols benefit the entire community. First off, there are no secrets. Developers can review the code and gain an understanding of how it all works. This is important when large volumes of value are traded. Not knowing this information would be a huge risk as it forces users to put blind trust in the programs that are running. Whether there is malicious intent or not, trusting closed software for the use case of financial transactions isn’t smart.



This is why we have adopted Metaplex’s AuctionHouse protocol, a decentralized sales contract for NFTs on Solana. Their code is open and available for anyone to use. Now that it has begun to be adopted among many projects and thanks to the escrowless nature of the contract, there is an innate flexibility that further enhances the utility of Solana NFTs. 



Since open source enables software to be used by many, improvements in the way of bug fixes and feature updates submitted by the community occur. Its this collective effort that ultimately makes the product more secure and better all around. The day we soft launched the Holaplex Marketplace Standard, the Skeleton Crew had quickly deployed their version of the codebase. In the process, they found opportunities to improve the code and even add in more functionality which we were excited to integrate. The magic of all of this is it just happened all on its own. 



Holaplex’s open-sourced technologies have already seen great benefits by way of contributions from a community for integration partners. This has enabled new features to be quickly introduced, making us the preferred technology collaborator in the industry. So far we have implemented contributions from [Cardinal](https://www.cardinal.so/) (identity verification) [Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/) (notifications) [Bridgesplit](https://bridgesplit.com/) (fractionalization) and [Notifi](https://notifi.network/) (storefront notifications) with many more partners in the pipeline. 



## All licenses are not created equal



We’ve been using the term Open Source Software so far, to talk about the difference between closed source software and open source software.  But all types of open source software are not the same. The method that people use to make their code either open or not is via a software license.  Usually the goal of open source software is to confer the right to see, incorporate, and otherwise utilize the software.  Weak open source licenses may confer those rights, but they don’t prevent the recipient from failing to propagate those rights as they expand or enhance the software.  The result of weak licensing is that someone can take your open source code, enhance it, and make those enhancements proprietary, and closed source.

To prevent someone from changing your intentions of delivering value to an ecosystem, you should use a strong open source license, also commonly known as “copyleft” licenses.  These licenses (e.g,, GPLv3, AGPL) prevent people from taking the rights that you conferred to them from others.  They protect your intention, and the integrity of the software.  Enhancements or useful modifications to copylefted software remain open source as well, and ensure that the benefits that you gave others are protected.



## How do open source projects make money?



Open source projects make money the same way closed source projects do.  By selling services or support, by utilizing the software within their business for the creation of profit making activities, or nearly every other way that people make money with software.  It is a common fallacy that keeping code secret protects your business.  It actually does nothing of the kind.



On top of these more traditional ways of making money enabled by software, web3 has the added advantage of crypto-currency, usually in the form of tokens. Tokens can be used to create and incentivized ecosystem of multiple participants on both sides of a transaction.  For example, individuals could sell compute services, other individuals can buy those services, and tokens can be used as payment.  In such a closed ecosystem, utilization drives the value of the token being used as payment, and so the more adoption, the higher the value.  Open source means more adoption. 



There are many more examples, but just the one mentioned above is enough to have created a 3 trillion dollar set of businesses ($3,000,000,000,000.00).



## Open-source is good for creators



For creators there is a distinct advantage in ensuring the industry adopts open standards and protocols. Specifically creators benefit from increased flexibility, freedom of choice and continuity. We all remember the headaches of mint hashes and JSON code required to list on closed secondary markets. Because of AuctionHouse this is no longer needed. 



If we fail to adopt these open protocols there is risk of multiple technology stacks being built none of which are compatible, factionalizing us rather than uniting us. Furthermore if technologies that get adopted are closed, we are putting blind trust into these entities and have no way of verifying their technology performs as promised. 



On the other hand, if open-source protocols and standards get adopted it further increases the flexibility creators have with distribution mechanisms of content, sales and collectors. 



For example, Holapelx is working with the industry to adopt the Holaplex Social Graph,  a social NFT network for Solana. This protocol enables follow / following of wallet profiles which then builds a personalized data stream from activities of followed accounts. The  ‘Alpha Feed' is similar to the feeds one might be used to on social media. But, there is a distinct difference. All the followers that a given wallet collects get stored on the blockchain and is directly associated with that wallet. This means that they own their follower base and is portable to any other platform that adopts this open-source protocol. Imagine if you could port your Twitter followers to your Youtube channel. This is possible only if we adopt decentralized and open-sourced technologies. 



This time, we have the opportunity to do this right. We have the opportunity to ensure that creators get to see the majority of the benefit where wealth is distributed truly on performance and the value that is brought. The moment is now to enthusiastically embrace and even demand radical openness for if we don’t then we will revert back to the maximally extractive systems. There are too many ‘crypto’ companies masquerading as Web3 companies but in reality are essentially Web2 that use a blockchain to store some information. Creators, you are what makes the NFT ecosystem exists. You have the power and if you believe in the vision then now is not the time to be complacent. The movement has begun, let's win together. 



## Additional information:



Source code is the human readable set of instructions that programmers use to create software.  Any programmer skilled in the art can read source code written by any other programmer and understand the thought process and algorithms used to create the software.



Closed source software is software where the creators of the source code do not allow other people/programmers to view it.  Often this is done because the creators of the software believe that they are protecting special trade secrets.  Meanwhile, Open Source software allows anyone to view it.  Let’s talk about how the different types of software licenses affect technology and business.
