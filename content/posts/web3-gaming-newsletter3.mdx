## Epic League Enters Partnership with Polygon

![](uploads/untitled-4-750x430.png)

"EPIC LEAGUE, the web3 games development studio, has announced a new strategic partnership with Polygon this week. Some of the key aspects of the partnership include the interesting combination of EPIC LEAGUE’s high-spec blockchain game dev services and Polygon’s well-established reputation as a technology provider for ambitious on-chain projects.

Along with the partnership, Polygon Ventures, Polygon’s VC arm, has also made a strategic investment in the organisation. This new investment follows EPIC LEAGUE’s successful strategic and private funding round at $60m and $100mm fully diluted valuation.

Urvit Goel, VP of Global Business Development for Gaming at Polygon, said: “Epic League has the potential to bring new users to Web3 through its gaming ecosystem. The team’s prior experience working with major gaming and entertainment firms bodes well for its future. We’re delighted to bring Epic League into the Polygon ecosystem and are excited for our customers to be able to play Dark Thrones and future Epic League titles.”

The first point of collaboration between these two will be EPIC’s launch of its AAA action RPG – Dark Throne – exclusively on Polygon.

Supported by a highly experienced team of developers, with dramatic visuals developed under Jeehyung Lee – the games Art Director and a cover artist for both Marvel and DC comics – there has been a lot of time invested into Dark Throne to have it strike a fine balance between AAA gameplay, desktop & mobile interoperability, and blockchain functionality.

DARK THRONE, launching in Q3, 2022, completed a [successful beta test](https://medium.com/epicleagueteam/dark-throne-beta-test-report-c2191675019f) in June 2022, demonstrating a notable 67.8% retention rate among its players on the seventh day of the beta test..."

## Blockchain Games Were Still Not Affected Despite Ongoing Crypto Winter

![](uploads/screenshot_2.png)

"Blockchain games are still performing well even though crypto projects were down due to the recent market crash. Since May, the market has been in a downtrend, but blockchain games were coping with the market, indicating independence from the trend.

Every bear market crushes the small investor’s hope to get rich quickly, but one thing it also does that needs to be done is weed out unnecessary frills. It does cripple portfolios of investors but enables legit projects to shine.

This market condition is no different from the other – we are seeing a crypto downtrend, and yet metaverse projects and blockchain games are not being affected, making us more bullish than ever on the space.

Blockchain games ramped up by 9.51% in Q2 despite the bear market. The space also saw $2.5 billion invested in the first and second quarters this year..."
