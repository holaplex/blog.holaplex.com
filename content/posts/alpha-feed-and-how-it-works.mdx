Alpha feed is a real time log of notable NFT events that take place on Solana. Each event catalogs when it occurred, the object associated with the event, and wallets related to the event. For example, a mint event creates an event association for each creator and a listing event for the seller.

## How do I use it?

After you connect your wallet to Holaplex you can start following other wallets on-chain using our social graph program. Once youâ€™ve followed a few of your favorite creators and collectors your Alpha Feed will display events generated by the wallets you are following.

## What events are supported?

Mint - A creator you follow mints an nft from any marketplace using any program. Listing - A wallet you follow puts a NFT up for sale. Offer - A collector you follow makes an offer. Purchase - A collector or seller you follow completes a sale (or accepts an offer).

Listings, offers, and purchase events are generated by receipt accounts produced by the @metaplex Auction House contract.

## What makes it realtime?

Holaplex watches the Solana blockchain by running a pair of read-only validators equipped with a geyser plugin that pushes account changes to a message bus as they are being accepted by the network. A pool of consumers deserialize the accounts into Postgres models and save into the Holaplex Index.

When an account is indexed for the first time by the Holaplex Indexer an event is generated for it.

## Where is it going?

Listing, offer, and purchase events are being expanded to cover all of Auction House transactions, not just ones making use of receipts.

Events for marketplaces running forks of the Auction House contract.

Partner with other ecosystem projects to expose more event types for the community.

Let users follow non-system accounts, such as Candy Machines and Metaplex Certified Collections.

Finally, it feels great to share all the code for our work with you. Remember Holaplex is 100% open source and here to progress the long term success of NFTs and their applications in the open.
