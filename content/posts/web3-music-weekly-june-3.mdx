Happy Friday and welcome to the first edition of Web3 Music Weekly! Your new home for all the latest web3 music news, NFT releases, and more - curated weekly by Holaplex's own in-house music addict and NFT enthusiast, [Blake Nania](twitter.com/wetheblake).

#### Intro

First off, I'd like to give a big round of üëè disco clapsüëè  to all of you for being here. If there's one thing I've learned in my 10 years of experience in the music industry, it pays to be early. As a longtime curator, collector, and die hard fan of music, there is not a more exciting space to be than where we are right now. This is the wild wild west, the internet 3.0, where guidelines are meant to be broken and newfound innovation is setting the groundwork for how we engage with art and music for many years to come. We are at the precipice of a new-age art renaissance and we hope this space serves as a resource to help inform and inspire the next generation of creatives, developers, and fans alike.

#### What's Going On

There is an industry-wide shift occurring at the moment in the way we consume and interact with art and music. Through web3, open-source, and the foundation platforms like Holaplex are building, the power of how and when an artist releases their art is finally being returned to where it always should've been, back into the hands of the creator. Third parties (The Middlemen), who for years have forced artists to sacrifice a piece of themselves to have any chance at living a sustainable life, are no longer the ones in control. By purchasing an NFT, fans are now able to directly support and connect with an artist on a much deeper level than ever before. Every week, we'll be showcasing some of the innovative projects changing the game. We hope to see you here, every Friday.
